        Hi! I'm Wika, a full-stack web developer who usually works with Laravel, Tailwind, and sometimes Node.js. I enjoy learning new things and currently exploring Next.js and FastAPI. I recently took a course on cloud computing to expand my knowledge. I like writing clean and organized code with a modular structure, so it's easier to develop in the future. For me, coding is not just about work, but also a way to keep learning and growing in the world of technology.
